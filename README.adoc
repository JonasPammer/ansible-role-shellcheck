If interested, I've also written down some
https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-ansible-role/blob/master/ROLE_DEVELOPMENT_TIPS.adoc[
General Ansible Role Development (Best) Practices].

[[versioning]]
=== üî¢ Versioning

Versions are defined using https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging[Tags],
which in turn are https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/version.html[recognized and used] by Ansible Galaxy.

*Versions must not start with `v`.*

When a new tag is pushed, https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-shellcheck/actions/workflows/release-to-galaxy.yml[
a GitHub CI workflow]
(image:https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-shellcheck/actions/workflows/release-to-galaxy.yml/badge.svg[Release CI])
takes care of importing the role to my Ansible Galaxy Account.

[[testing]]
=== üß™ Testing
Automatic Tests are run on each Contribution using GitHub Workflows.

The Tests primarily resolve around running https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Molecule]
on a <<tested-distributions,varying set of linux distributions>>
and using <<tested-ansible-versions,various ansible versions>>.

The molecule test also includes a step which lints all ansible playbooks using
https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint#readme[`ansible-lint`]
to check for best practices and behaviour that could potentially be improved.

To run the tests, simply run `tox` on the command line.
You can pass an optional environment variable to define the distribution of the
Docker container that will be spun up by molecule:

----
$ MOLECULE_DISTRO=ubuntu2204 tox
----

For a list of possible values fed to `MOLECULE_DISTRO`,
take a look at the matrix defined in link:.github/workflows/ci.yml[].

==== üêõ Debugging a Molecule Container

1. Run your molecule tests with the option `MOLECULE_DESTROY=never`, e.g.:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
$ *MOLECULE_DESTROY=never MOLECULE_DISTRO=#ubuntu1604# tox -e py3-ansible-#5#*
...
  TASK [ansible-role-pip : (redacted).] pass:[************************]
  failed: [instance-py3-ansible-9] => changed=false
...
 pass:[___________________________________ summary ____________________________________]
  pre-commit: commands succeeded
ERROR:   py3-ansible-9: commands failed
----

2. Find out the name of the molecule-provisioned docker container:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
$ *docker ps*
#30e9b8d59cdf#   geerlingguy/docker-debian10-ansible:latest   "/lib/systemd/systemd"   8 minutes ago   Up 8 minutes                                                                                                    instance-py3-ansible-9
----

3. Get into a bash Shell of the container, and do your debugging:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
$ *docker exec -it #30e9b8d59cdf# /bin/bash*

root@instance-py3-ansible-2:/#
----
+
[TIP]
====
If the failure you try to debug is part of your `verify.yml` step and not the actual `converge.yml`,
you may want to know that the output of ansible's modules (`vars`), hosts (`hostvars`) and
environment variables have been stored into files on both the provisioner and inside the docker machine under:
* `/var/tmp/vars.yml` (contains host variables under the `hostvars` key)
* `/var/tmp/environment.yml`
`grep`, `cat` or transfer these as you wish!
====
+
[TIP]
=====
You may also want to know that the files mentioned in the admonition above
are attached to the *GitHub CI Artifacts* of a given Workflow run. +
This allows one to check the difference between runs
and thus help in debugging what caused the bit-rot or failure in general.

=====

4. After you finished your debugging, exit it and destroy the container:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
root@instance-py3-ansible-2:/# *exit*

$ *docker stop #30e9b8d59cdf#*

$ *docker container rm #30e9b8d59cdf#*
_or_
$ *docker container prune*
----

==== üêõ Debugging installed package versions locally

Although a standard feature in tox 3, this https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/pull/2794[now] only happens when tox recognizes the presence of a CI variable.
For example:

----
$ CI=true tox
----


[[development-container-extra]]
=== üßÉ TIP: Containerized Ideal Development Environment

This Project offers a definition for a "1-Click Containerized Development Environment".

This Container even enables one to run docker containers inside of it (Docker-In-Docker, dind),
allowing for molecule execution.

To use it:

1. Ensure you fullfill the link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_system-requirements[
   the System requirements of Visual Studio Code Development Containers],
   optionally following the __Installation__-Section of the linked page section. +
   This includes: Installing Docker, Installing Visual Studio Code itself, and Installing the necessary Extension.
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Open the folder of the repo in Visual Studio Code (_File - Open Folder‚Ä¶_).
4. If you get a prompt at the lower right corner informing you about the presence of the devcontainer definition,
you can press the accompanying button to enter it.
*Otherwise,* you can also execute the Visual Studio Command `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container` yourself (_View - Command Palette_ -> _type in the mentioned command_).

[TIP]
====
I recommend using `Remote-Containers: Rebuild Without Cache and Reopen in Container`
once here and there as the devcontainer feature does have some problems recognizing
changes made to its definition properly some times.
====

[NOTE]
=====
You may need to configure your host system to enable the container to use your SSH/GPG Keys.

The procedure is described https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials[
in the official devcontainer docs under "Sharing Git credentials with your container"].

This Project shall be kept in sync with
https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-ansible-role[the CookieCutter it was originally templated from]

==== üïó Changelog
When a new tag is pushed, an appropriate GitHub Release will be created
by the Repository Maintainer to provide a proper human change log with a title and description.


[[pre-commit]]
=== ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Linting and Styling Conventions
General Linting and Styling Conventions are
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/20/linters-arent-in-your-way-theyre-on-your-side/[*automatically* held up to Standards]
by various https://pre-commit.com/[`pre-commit`] hooks, at least to some extend.

Automatic Execution of pre-commit is done on each Contribution using
https://pre-commit.ci/[`pre-commit.ci`]<<note_pre-commit-ci,*>>.
Pull Requests even automatically get fixed by the same tool,
at least by hooks that automatically alter files.

[NOTE]
====
Not to confuse:
Although some pre-commit hooks may be able to warn you about script-analyzed flaws in syntax or even code to some extend (for which reason pre-commit's hooks are *part of* the test suite),
pre-commit itself does not run any real Test Suites.
For Information on Testing, see <<testing>>.
====

[TIP]
====
[[note_pre-commit-ci]]
Nevertheless, I recommend you to integrate pre-commit into your local development workflow yourself.

This can be done by cd'ing into the directory of your cloned project and running `pre-commit install`.
Doing so will make git run pre-commit checks on every commit you make,
aborting the commit themselves if a hook alarm'ed.

You can also, for example, execute pre-commit's hooks at any time by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.

// Included in README.adoc
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

The following sections are generic in nature and are used to help new contributors.
The actual "Development Documentation" of this project is found under <<development>>.

=== ü§ù Preamble
First off, thank you for considering contributing to this Project.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

[[cookiecutter--contributing]]
=== üç™ CookieCutter
This Project owns many of its files to
https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-ansible-role[the CookieCutter it was originally templated from].

Please check if the edit you have in mind is actually applicable to the template
and if so make an appropriate change there instead.
Your change may also be applicable partly to the template
as well as partly to something specific to this project,
in which case you would be creating multiple PRs.

=== üí¨ Conventional Commits

A casual contributor does not have to worry about following
https://github.com/JonasPammer/JonasPammer/blob/master/demystifying/conventional_commits.adoc[__the spec__]
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[__by definition__],
as pull requests are being squash merged into one commit in the project.
Only core contributors, i.e. those with rights to push to this project's branches, must follow it
(e.g. to allow for automatic version determination and changelog generation to work).

=== üöÄ Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).
A few general guidelines that cover both:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
* If you've never contributed before, see https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/[
  the first timer's guide on Auth0's blog] for resources and tips on how to get started.

==== Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes *before* a PR is created.
When you https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-shellcheck/issues/new[
create a new Issue], a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having,
please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue *rather than creating a new one*.
Adding a https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/[reaction]
can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

==== Pull Requests

PRs to this Project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release.
https://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/[In general], PRs should:

* Only fix/add the functionality in question *OR* address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
* Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
* *Address a single concern*
* *Include documentation* in the repo
* Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release),
it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
